# Sundial

Sundial is a modern, clever (but not 'smart') radio alarm clock work in progress I'm building as a personal project. The idea is to have an alarm clock that fits my very specific standards of:

* Starts at, or around, sunrise each day.

* Starts at a low volume and increases to a high volume.

* Draws from multiple sources to provide not only live radio but also weather updates and any news feeds wanted.

I'm eventually planning to integrate this into a raspberry pi or similar, and have a nice looking little alarm clock.

I'm building this for fun and for personal use, so it probably won't ever have any generic user-friendly features. But feel free to take a look, fork it, do what you want with it.

This project currently uses https://sunrise-sunset.org/ for sun info. I might switch to calculating locally if I can find a good package for it later.
